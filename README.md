## Projects

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/deep-learning-email-classification/blob/main/images/thumbnail_email_classification.jpg">

**[Machine / Deep Learning classification and NLP analysis of emails](https://github.com/lgucrl/deep-learning-email-classification/)**  
This project builds an end-to-end pipeline in Python to **classify emails as SPAM vs. HAM (non-spam)** and then perform detailed **NLP analyses** on the resulting groups. In addition to supervised classification, it explores the **main topics** of SPAM emails, the **differences/similarities** of SPAM topics, and the **organizations mentioned** in non-spam messages.

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/deep-learning-toxic-comments-classification/blob/main/images/thumbnail_comments_toxicity.png"> 

**[Deep Learning multi-label classification of online toxic comments](https://github.com/lgucrl/deep-learning-toxic-comments-classification/)**  
This deep learning project builds a detection and classification system for **toxic comments** on social platforms: given an online comment, the model predicts whether it contains one or more types of toxicity. The classifier is implemented in **Python** using **TensorFlow/Keras** and outputs a **6-dimensional vector of binary labels** (one per toxicity category).

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-wikipedia-classification/blob/main/images/thumbnail_wikipedia_classification.jpg"> 

**[Machine Learning multi-class classification of Wikipedia articles](https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-wikipedia-classification)**  
This repository contains an end-to-end **big data / NLP** pipeline with the goal of exploring English Wikipedia content and building an **automatic multi-class text classifier** able to assign each article to one of **15 thematic categories** (e.g., *Culture, Economics, Medicine, Technology, Politics, Science*) using **PySpark's Machine Learning Library (MLlib)**.

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-face-detection/blob/main/images/thumbnail_face_detection.png"> 

**[Machine Learning face detection](https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-face-detection)**  
This project implements a **lightweight face detection pipeline** in Python aimed at running with **limited computing capacity** by using **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** features and a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to distinguish *face* vs *non-face* image patches. The trained classifier is applied using a **sliding-window** approach for detection in full-size images.

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-creditworthiness-estimation/blob/main/images/thumbnail_creditworthiness_estimation.jpg"> 

**[Machine Learning estimation of creditworthiness](https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-creditworthiness-estimation/)**  
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project in Python to estimate a bank customer’s **creditworthiness** and support decisions on **credit card issuance**. The goal is to build a model that predicts a binary TARGET where 1 = high creditworthiness (consistent installment payments) and 0 = otherwise, using anonymized customer profile data.

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-cross-selling-prediction/blob/main/images/thumbnail_insurance_prediction.jpg"> 

**[Machine Learning prediction of insurance cross-selling](https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-cross-selling-prediction)**  
This project builds a supervised **binary classification** model in Python that helps an insurance company identify **cross-selling opportunities**: among existing customers, who is most likely to be interested in purchasing an additional **vehicle insurance** policy. The work follows an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline, comparing multiple algorithms and thresholds to balance decision strategies.

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/newborn-statistical-inference-analysis/blob/main/images/thumbnail_newborn_inference.jpg"> 

**[Statistical Inference Analysis to predict newborn weight](https://github.com/lgucrl/newborn-statistical-inference-analysis)**  
This repository contains an **inferential statistics** project in R with the goal of building, validating, and interpreting a statistical model capable of **predicting newborn weight** from collected clinical variables, such as maternal, pregnancy, and newborn measurements. The analysis combines classical hypothesis testing with multiple linear regression, model selection, diagnostics, and scenario-based prediction.

<img align="left" width="240" height="160" src="https://github.com/lgucrl/real-estate-exploratory-data-analysis/blob/main/images/thumbnail_real_estate_EDA.jpg"> 

**[Exploratory Data Analysis of the Texas Real Estate Market](https://github.com/lgucrl/real-estate-exploratory-data-analysis)**  
This project carries out an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the Texas residential real estate market using R (including **dplyr**, **ggplot2**, and **moments** libraries). The goal is to apply descriptive statistics and data-visualization techniques to understand how sales activity and prices evolve across cities, months, and years.
